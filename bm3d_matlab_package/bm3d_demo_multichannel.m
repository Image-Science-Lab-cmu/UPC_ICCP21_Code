[noise, PSD, kernel] = getExperimentNoise(noise_type, noise_var, seed, size(y));
% N.B.: For the sake of simulating a more realistic acquisition scenario,
% the generated noise is *not* circulant. Therefore there is a slight
% discrepancy between PSD and the actual PSD computed from infinitely many
% realizations of this noise with different seeds.

% Generate noisy image corrupted by additive spatially correlated noise
% with noise power spectrum PSD
z = y + noise;

% Call BM3D With the default settings.
y_est = BM3D(z, PSD);

% If different channels have different PSDs, they can be passed
% concatenated in the 3rd dimension (for all settings):
% y_est = BM3D(z, cat(3, PSD1, PSD2));

% To include refiltering:
% y_est = BM3D(z, PSD, 'refilter');

% For other settings, use BM3DProfile.
% profile = BM3DProfile(); % equivalent to profile = BM3DProfile('np');
% profile.gamma = 6;  % redefine value of gamma parameter
% y_est = BM3D(z, PSD, profile);

% Note: For white noise, you may instead of the PSD 
% also pass a standard deviation 
% y_est = BM3D(z, sqrt(noise_var));
% or multiple standard deviations
% y_est = BM3D(z, [sigma1, sigma2]);
